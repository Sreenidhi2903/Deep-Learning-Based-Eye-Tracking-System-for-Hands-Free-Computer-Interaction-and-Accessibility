# Deep-Learning-Based-Eye-Tracking-System-for-Hands-Free-Computer-Interaction-and-Accessibility
The eye-tracking system that allows individuals with spinal cord injuries, limb impairments, or other mobility challenges to control a computer mouse cursor using only their eyes. By deep learning, methods Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with the ResNet-34 architecture, the system interprets eye movements and blinks. 
The model is trained on eye movement data to ensure precise and responsive cursor control. It utilizes advanced image processing to detect facial landmarks and translate gaze direction into real-time cursor movement. Blinking is also incorporated as a click function, allowing users to perform actions without any physical interaction.
It contributes significantly to assistive technology by offering an innovative solution that narrows the accessibility gap for people with physical disabilities. It underscores the potential of eye-tracking technology in enhancing accessibility and emphasizes the importance of continued research and development to make this technology widely available and user-friendly. The eye-controlled mouse cursor system holds great promise for improving the lives of countless individuals with limited mobility and contributes to a more inclusive digital world
I compared four Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures: for the eye-controlled mouse cursor system, LeNet demonstrated a remarkable accuracy of 97.32% after 100 epochs of training. Its capacity to decipher intricate patterns within eye movement images highlights its suitability for precise eye movement prediction. On the other hand, AlexNet, a trailblazer in computer vision, displayed a respectable accuracy of 87.56% after the same 100 epochs. Despite a slightly lower accuracy compared to other architectures, AlexNet remains a viable choice. VGGNet, known for its uniform architecture and deep layers, showcased a solid accuracy of 91.68% after the 100 epochs, emphasizing its proficiency in understanding pertinent patterns linked to eye movements.
